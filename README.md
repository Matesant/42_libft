> The aim of this project is to get to know and recode some of the general functions fund in C, which will be used in future projects.

<br>

```asciidoc
At Ã‰cole 42, we are encouraged to reimplement functionalities from scratch.
This project serves the purpose of deepening our understanding of functions that already exist in standard libraries.
Similar to the initial project, we start by creating fundamental versions of these functions, adhering to explicit limitations.
As we advance through the curriculum, we are permitted to enhance our library by adding extra functions and features to our Libft.
This iterative process not only solidifies our understanding of core concepts
 but also fosters creativity and the ability to expand on existing knowledge.

<summary><h2>ðŸš² Usage:</h2></summary>

> The library is written in C language and needs the `gcc` compiler to run.

- `make` - compiles all mandatory functions
- `make bonus` - Compiles all bonus functions
- `make re` - cleans everything and recompiles all files
- `make clean` - removes all object files
- `make fclean` - cleans everything
